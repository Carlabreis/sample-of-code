# sample-of-code

I volunteer at a nonprofit, and I am part of the front-end team.
This is the checkout page for their e-commerce website, just one of the components I built for the project. It is not completed yet, it has some comments left and few things still to do, but it demonstrates some of my coding skills and knowledge of React.
